                <p>Throughout my life, I’ve had many interests — from drawing to magic — but one passion has always remained constant: <b>creative writing.</b></p>
                <p>I’ve always enjoyed writing, especially fiction and short tales. My style focuses on short-form writing — unlike novels, my pieces are usually only a few paragraphs long.</p>
