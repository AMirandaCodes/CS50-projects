# Module 8 – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This module introduced the fundamentals of **web development**, focusing on how websites are structured (HTML), styled (CSS), and made interactive (JavaScript).  
Across the two assignments, the module emphasised semantic markup, responsive design, DOM manipulation, event handling, UX feedback, and multi-page website organisation.

## Problem Set 8

### 1. Trivia

- **Task**: Build an interactive trivia webpage consisting of:
  - One multiple-choice question (Part 1)
  - One free-response question (Part 2)

- **Requirements & Features**:
  - Use **HTML** to structure each question with headings, buttons, and input fields.
  - Use **CSS** to style the page.
  - Use **JavaScript** to:
    - Detect user clicks or submissions
    - Display feedback (“Correct!” or “Incorrect”) beneath each question
    - Change button/input colours (green for correct, red for incorrect)
  - Ensure exactly one correct answer per multiple-choice question.

- **Concepts**:
  - DOM selection and manipulation  
  - Event listeners  
  - Client-side input validation  
  - Basic UI/UX feedback  
  - HTML structure, semantics, and button behaviour  
  - Inline vs. external styling  

### 2. Homepage

- **Task**: Create a personal multi-page website about yourself, a hobby, or any topic of interest.

- **Requirements & Features**:
  - At least **four HTML pages**, all connected via hyperlinks.
  - Use **at least 10 distinct HTML tags** (e.g., `p`, `h1`, `nav`, `img`, `ul`, etc.).
  - Integrate **Bootstrap** for layout or interactive components (e.g., navbars, cards, grids).
  - Include at least **five CSS selectors** of your own in `styles.css` (classes, IDs, tags).
  - Ensure consistent design across all pages.
  - Optional JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., buttons, dynamic content).

- **Concepts**:
  - Multi-page website architecture  
  - Navigation design & linking  
  - Responsive design with Bootstrap  
  - External CSS and custom selectors  
  - Web styling conventions and accessibility basics  
  - Hosting a local development server  

This module marked the transition from command-line programs to **visual, interactive software**, laying the groundwork for future work with frameworks, APIs, and full-stack development.
