# Python Module – CS50 Problem Sets

This module revisits earlier programming problems implemented in C, now rewritten in **Python** to explore cleaner syntax, dynamic typing, and improved readability. In addition, a new problem — **DNA** — introduces working with files, CSV data, and string pattern analysis.  

## Overview

The Python module focuses on:
- Translating logic from C into Pythonic syntax.
- Using Python’s `cs50` library for user input.
- Practicing loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Introducing file handling and CSV parsing.
- Understanding algorithmic problem-solving in a high-level language.

## Problem set

The problem set includes:
1. **Hello, Again**: Prompts the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting, e.g. hello, David.
3. **Mario (Less)**: Prompts for a height (1–8) and prints a left-aligned half-pyramid of hashes (#), re-prompting for invalid input.
4. **Mario (More)**: Prints two side-by-side pyramids separated by two spaces, using the same height input logic as Mario (Less)
5. **Cash**: Calculates the minimum number of U.S. coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) needed to make change. Re-prompts if input is invalid.
6. **Credit**: Implements credit card validation using Luhn’s Algorithm, identifying AMEX, MasterCard, or VISA numbers.
7. **Readability**: Analyses text using the Coleman-Liau formula to estimate its U.S. grade reading level, from Before Grade 1 to Grade 16+.
8. **DNA**: Compares a DNA sequence against a CSV database of Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) to identify whose DNA it most likely is.
