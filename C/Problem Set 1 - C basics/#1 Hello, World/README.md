# Problem 1: Hello, World

## Project Brief 
The task was to write a simple program that prints `hello, world` followed by a newline.

## Approach
This exercise is about:
- Learning the structure of a C program.
- Understanding how to include standard libraries.
- Practicing syntax and building “muscle memory” for writing code.

## My solution
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
