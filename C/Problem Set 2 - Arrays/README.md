## Module 2 – Arrays

This module introduced the concept of arrays in C and how they can be used to store and manipulate collections of data.
The assignments explored text processing, scoring systems, and classic encryption methods, reinforcing skills in loops, indexing, and string manipulation.

### Problem set 2
#### 1. Scrabble

- **Task**: Prompt two players for words and compute their scores using Scrabble letter values. Declare the winner or a tie.
- **Concepts**: Arrays, character-to-index mapping, case-insensitivity, string traversal.

#### 2. Readability

- **Task**: Implement a program that calculates the approximate U.S. grade level required to read a given text, using the Coleman-Liau index.
- **Concepts**: String processing, counting letters/words/sentences, arithmetic formulas, conditional output.

#### 3. Caesar

- **Task**: Encrypt a plaintext message using Caesar’s cipher, shifting each alphabetical character by a key provided as a command-line argument. Preserve case, ignore non-alphabetical characters.
- **Concepts**: Command-line arguments, modular arithmetic (`%`), ASCII values, character wrapping, string manipulation.

#### 4. Substitution

- **Task**: Encrypt a plaintext message using a substitution cipher defined by a 26-letter key provided at runtime. Validate the key and preserve case.
- **Concepts**: Command-line arguments, validation logic, mapping arrays, substitution algorithms, preserving case sensitivity.
