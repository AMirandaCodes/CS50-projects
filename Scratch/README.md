## Module 0 – Scratch  

The first module was an introduction to programming concepts through **Scratch** at [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu).  

The goal was to create any project (game, story, or animation) that met these requirements:  
- At least **two sprites** (one not being the cat).  
- At least **three scripts total**.  
- Use of **one conditional**, **one loop**, and **one variable**.  
- At least **one custom block** with an input.  
- A project that is **more complex than lecture demos** but simpler than full-featured games like *Oscartime*.  

The assignment emphasised:  
- **Abstraction** (breaking long scripts into smaller blocks).  
- **Step-by-step development** (build, test, improve).  
- **Well-designed code** using Scratch’s visual building blocks.  

This module laid the foundation for problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and structured project design.  

## My Scratch Project - Arctic Escape

**Arctic Escape** is a simple game where the player controls a penguin trying to navigate through an icy maze while avoiding obstacles.

### How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the penguin across the ice.  
- Avoid the snowballs (if you touch them, they send you back to the starting point)
- Reach the igloo to complete the level.
